# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

Veeam Cloud Connect integrates cloud backup repository directly into your Veeam backup console and you manage all of the processes. If required, it is possible to restore every single file or an entire virtual machine."
          backup_rule: "The 3-2-1 rule states that you need to keep three copies of your data, stored on two types of media, with one copy being off site. Getting backups off site can be challenging due to limited bandwidth, exploding data volumes and a lack of resources required to build or maintain a true offsite backup repository. With Veeam Cloud Connect, you can master the 3-2-1 rule without dumping money."

Data protection evolved from classic daily (occasional) backup to replication of data in real time. To satisfy the need to save backup to remote location, easiest and most reliable way is the backup in the cloud. Service only needs internet connection to operate. "
